## Parking Management System

Over the years, technology has revolutionized our world and daily lives. Present day parkingspace in urban areas is very difficult during peak hours due to the lack of parking spaces.Nowadays automated systems are rapidly used in developed countries. We have designedan intelligent parking system that has the count of free slots for automobiles in the parkingarea on the list of them. The system can direct them to one of the free slots. Smart parkingsolutions enable the municipalities to manage and reduce parking search traffic on the streets.This technology also ensures parking safety, but its major contribution to traffic congestionis the factor of making the parking experience faster, more convenient, and hassle-free.

**Objective**

1.  To identify the presence or absence of a vehicle at the gate.

2.  To show the free slot- where the vehicle is expected to go.

3.  Make the parking system automated and smooth.
